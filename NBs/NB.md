### Why do we need JSX?
JSX is a superset of Javascript (JS + XML). It was developed by Meta for string interpolation /combining logic and markup/. It can be used in React, but also plain Javascript will do the same. Some schools of thaught advocate the use of JSX for components and that be separate from the JS files that deal with hooks, contexts and other logical structures.

### Improvements for Ixora:
- mx-auto centers the contained div within the container div based on the x axis
- Better navbar, especially, the change of color on window.scrollY !== 0

### Others:
JIT - If you are using the Next.js App Router, you do not need to set the JIT mode of Tailwind CSS as it is automatically enabled by Next.js. This is because Next.js uses the new Just-in-Time (JIT) engine by default, which allows for faster and more optimized CSS loading.
