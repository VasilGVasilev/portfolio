### Why do we need JSX?
JSX is a superset of Javascript (JS + XML). It was developed by Meta for string interpolation /combining logic and markup/. It can be used in React, but also plain Javascript will do the same. Some schools of thaught advocate the use of JSX for components and that be separate from the JS files that deal with hooks, contexts and other logical structures.
